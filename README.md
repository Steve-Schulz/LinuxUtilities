# LinuxUtilities

This is the public repo of terrible little scripts I use for linux management. Anytime I find myself using a non-standard method (e.g. using a script running apt commands instead of unattended-upgrades) I like to keep that script available somewhere. This repo is to allow me to move files from my private repo to a public one so the scripts can be w-getted without any authentication for servers that might not have Git configured, or are in an isolated network, or are restricted in some other way.

## Usage
    * The scripts are generic and basically used by me, and only updated by me. If they work for your purposes, cool.
    * Do not trust these or any other scripts you get from the internet.
